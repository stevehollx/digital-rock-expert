Use a list of songs and spotify URLs to play a song guessing game digitally.

I use this to play with family, groups, and parties where we guess rock songs, since paid commercial versions of this game are focused on pop music.

You can choose how deep into the billboard charts you want to go for each year. There is a bit of a selection bias towards later years if you go over 20 hits per year, since there are only 20 hits recorded each
year in 1950 - 1956, and 40 until 1965. 1966 - present has 100 records per year.

Because this is mainly played as a group game at a couch or table, code is shared via a python notebook. I like to run the notebook in pythonista on my ipad and mirror the screen to a TV so everyone can see the score. Then whoever is pared to a stereo scans the QR codes and plays the spotify URLs. The scanning person can still scan and flip their phone over and particiapte as part of a team without seeing what is playing.

Check out my getbillboardhits repo if you want to pull down other billboard charts. The code is a bit messy since I really only needed to pull this down once and you can grab my song file, but may be useful if you want hits from another genre or want to try and replace spotify with another streming service for the URLs.
